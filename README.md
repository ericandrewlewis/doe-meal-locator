## How to use this script
1. Recommend setting up a Python virtual environment first
2. Run `pip install requirements.txt`
3. Run `python scrape.py`

## Todo
1. It currently only prints the results - it should parse and save to CSV.
2. It currently only scrapes the results on the first page of results. I'm working on scraping all pages.
